                    <p>Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is a tax collection mechanism implemented by the Government of India to collect taxes at the source of income generation. It is a form of indirect tax collection, where the payer deducts a certain percentage of the amount payable as tax and deposits it with the government on behalf of the payee. This system helps ensure regular and timely collection of taxes and reduces tax evasion.</p>
					
                    <h3>TDS on Fantasy Gaming Apps</h3>
                    <p>TDS was deducted on the user's winnings of Rs. 10,000/- and above until March 31, 2023. Starting April 1, 2023, new TDS rules have been implemented with the following changes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>TDS will be deducted on the user's withdrawal amount, not on the user's pot winning amount.</li>
                        <li>The withdrawal amount will be subject to 30% TDS, calculated on the user's net winnings. This means the user will receive the winning amount in the Winnings, and TDS will only be deducted when the user withdraws.</li>
                        <li>User's Net Winnings from April to March will be calculated based on the following transactions:</li>
                        <li style="list-style:none">
							<ul>
								<li>User's total winnings</li>
								<li>User's total deposits</li>
								<li>Amount withdrawn by the user to date</li>
								<li>TDS paid by the user to date</li>
								<li>User's total outstanding amount in the Winnings as of March 31 of the Financial Year. In this case, the user's current balance as of March 31 of that year will be subject to TDS, and the remaining balance will be carried forward to the next Financial Year.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
                    </ul>
					
					<h3>TDS Calculation</h3>					
					<p>The TDS will be charged on Net Winnings, the formula for which will be:</p>
					<p>Net Winnings = Total Withdrawals (made in the FY including the current withdrawal transaction amount) - Total Deposits (made in the FY) - Opening balance as on 1st April 2023 (Deposit + Winning) - Amount on which TDS has been deducted w.e.f. 1st April 2023.</p>
					
					<h3>Illustrations</h3>
					<p><strong>Case 1: When User's Net Winnings are More than Rs. 0</strong></p>
					<p><strong>Assumption:</strong> User's opening balance on 1st April 2023 is Rs. 0 and no TDS has been deducted to date since 1 April 2023.</p>
